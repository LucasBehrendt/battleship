# Battleship

Battleship is a Python terminal game based on the classic with the same name. It is a turn-based guessing game where you play against the computer and try to sink your enemys battleships before your own fleet is destroyed. The user can choose both the grid size and the number of ships to be deployed on each board.

By developing the game on Code Institutes Python Template it can be run in a web browser, as opposed to only being able to run on a CLI or Command Line Interface.
